# hyperML
Radically simple, efficient platform that gets most of out Cloud Infrastrcuture for data science teams and Individuals. 

hyperML works with kubernetes to re-create python environments, launch or schedule notebooks and python jobs. If you are sharing resources then you can queue up requests as well.

[See demo](https://www.hyperml.com/demo.mp4)

## Problems solved
* Ease of use (follows general dialect of data science)
* Abstracts infrastructure from data scientists and ML engineers leting them focus more on science
* Scale ML experiments by effortlessly launching new notebooks or scheduling them to run in background
* Share infrastructure resources especially when there is shortage of it 
* Hassle free environments through container images


## Requirements
* Kubernetes (minikube, on-premise, AWS EKS or GKE or any public cloud) 

## Getting Started
Follow steps [here](https://www.hyperml.com/docs/prerequisites)

## User flow:

* **Launch notebooks** on click of a button  
* Install **locally** or on remote server (VM) or as a container inside kubernetes
* Simple CLI to run Python code bundles inside containers on kubernetes
