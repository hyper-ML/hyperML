# hyperML
Radically simple, efficient platform to improve lead time of data science projects. It does so by extending your local environment with on-demand cloud resources without having to leave your IDE (jupyter labs at the moment).

hyperML works with the help of kubernetes to reusable environments, launch or schedule notebooks and python jobs. If you are sharing resources then you can queue up requests as well.

[See demo](https://www.hyperml.com/demo.mp4)

## Problems solved
* Ease of use (follows general dialect of data science)
* Abstracts infrastructure from data scientists and ML engineers leting them focus more on science
* Scale ML experiments by effortlessly launching new notebooks or scheduling them to run in background
* Share infrastructure resources especially when there is shortage of it 
* Hassle free environments through container images


## Requirements
* Kubernetes (minikube, on-premise, AWS EKS or GKE or any public cloud) 

## Getting Started
A host of quick start guides are available on hyperML [website](https://www.hyperml.com/docs/prerequisites)
* [Standalone binary install](https://www.hyperml.com/docs/standalone)
* [Minikube Install](https://www.hyperml.com/docs/minikube)
* [Kubernetes Install](https://www.hyperml.com/docs/kubernetes)
* [AWS EKS]((https://www.hyperml.com/docs/aws-eks)
* [GCP GKE](https://www.hyperml.com/docs/gcp-gke)

## User flow:
* Run or Schedule **Notebooks to run in the background** right from the comform of jupyter labs  
* **Launch notebooks** on click of a button  
* Install **locally** or on remote server (VM) or as a container inside kubernetes
* Simple CLI to run Python code bundles inside containers on kubernetes
